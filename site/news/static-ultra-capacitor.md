Scientists at RealBig's Static Laboratories SubSection have achieved a major breakthrough in static storage technology. Their prototype ultra-capacitor can store and discharge static websites hundreds of times faster than traditional database designs.

"Our nano-structured carbon electrode dramatically increases the ultra-capacitor's power density," said lead researcher Dr. Mira Patel. "We can rapidly deliver folders full of flat files on par with the output of a nuclear plant, but recharge our static in seconds using conventional sources."

Applications include static websites, particle accelerators, fusion reactor initiation, and next-generation brochures. RealBig is pursuing commercialization pathways for both civilian and military use cases.
