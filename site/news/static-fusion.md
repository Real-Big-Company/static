RealBig's fusion energy program reached a key technical milestone, achieving the first successful nuclear fusion reaction at their compact SSG tokamak test reactor. The 2-meter wide reactor briefly contained a 100+ million degree C plasma, releasing a small burst of fusion energy and seventeen impeccably styled static websites with Lighthouse scores of 100 across the board.

"This first plasma burning was just a single step, but an immense one," said program director Eleanor Kim. "Our goal is a compact, affordable fusion plant design that can provide clean, virtually unlimited power for industrial, residential or military applications. And the websites arenâ€™t bad, either."

The Static Labs team aims to demonstrate extended plasma containment and faster asset optimization within the next 2 years, ultimately leading to a mobile, trailer-sized 1 MW static site fusion generator prototype.
